Food-Sales-Prediction Using Machine Learning to make future sales predictions

Author: Young Jin Jang

Business problem: Forcasting future sales of outlet stores based on informational data gathered by the stores.

Source:[The source of the dataset](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/) 

Data: That data used can be found in the link. (/Users/youngjinjang/Desktop/DOJO coding information/week 1/sales_predictions.csv). This data provides outlet sizes, year established and tier of outlets. Along with that it provides the data on the items being sold with relevent data to use on each item.

Methods:

- The first methods that I used were data cleaning.
- I checked the data for duplicates and deleted those. *Also checked for any missing data and made a decision on what to do with missing data.
- After that visualizations were made to represent the data.
- Then used preprocessing to prepare the data to be used in Machine Learning.
- After preprocessing ran the data through a Linear Regression and Decision Tree.
- Evaluated the models with MAE, MSE, RMSE and R^2 metrics to determine best model.
